<p>My story is about playing the 1st hole at my favorite Golf Course. I've been playing golf for about 20 years and it never get old. I chose golf because it's my way of relaxing and having fun.</p>
<p>The game of golf is played in the great outdoors. Every one must have their own golf clubs 14 including the putter. The object of the game is to get the ball in the hole with the lease amount of strokes as possible. Three types of holes par 3's, par 4's, and par 5's. par is when you get ball in the hole with 4 strokes on a par 4 and so on. </p>
<p><em>Hello I've made a change</em> </p>
<p>Hello I'm making a revised change that should fix the conflict.</p>
